## Problem Statement

Pension adoption among youth and informal sector workers remains low due to complex procedures, limited awareness, and lack of personalized financial guidance. Existing platforms provide information but fail to encourage consistent participation.

## Our Solution

NPS Buddy acts as an intelligent pension copilot that simplifies pension planning through personalized guidance, intuitive workflows, and behavioral engagement mechanisms.

The platform transforms static pension portals into interactive decision-support systems.
