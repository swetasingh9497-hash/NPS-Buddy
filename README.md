# NPS Buddy – AI Pension Copilot

NPS Buddy is an AI-powered pension engagement platform designed to simplify National Pension System (NPS) decisions, increase youth participation, and provide personalized retirement planning guidance.

Developed for the **PFRDA Hackathon** by Team Obsidian Circle.

## Problem Statement

Pension adoption among youth and informal sector workers remains low due to:

- Complex onboarding procedures
- Limited awareness of long-term benefits
- Lack of personalized financial guidance
- Static, information-heavy pension portals

Most existing platforms provide information but fail to encourage **consistent participation and informed decision-making**.

---

## Our Solution

NPS Buddy acts as an intelligent pension copilot that:

- Simplifies pension planning
- Provides personalized contribution guidance
- Visualizes long-term retirement outcomes
- Encourages consistent saving behavior

The platform transforms traditional pension portals into an **interactive decision-support system** tailored for young and first-time investors.

## How It Works

1. The user enters basic financial details such as age, income, and savings goals.
2. The system evaluates contribution capacity and retirement horizon.
3. A recommended NPS contribution strategy is generated.
4. The dashboard visualizes projected retirement outcomes and savings growth.
